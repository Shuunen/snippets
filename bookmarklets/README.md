My personal - useful or not - bookmarklets to make a better web


## Feedly filter

It will allow you to mark as read articles that match a banned list of words.

Just copy paste the content of feedly-filter-bookmark into a bookmark url & customize the word list.

An alternative is to fork and customize feedly-filter-custom & use feedly-filter-custom-bookmark.
