|                          | **Runtime**            | depending on ramping level | n/a        |

_Note : The above mentioned parameters are based on tests according to international flashlight testing standards (ANSI/NEMA FL1) using one 5000 mAh 21700 Li-ion battery in our laboratory. Results may vary with different battery or under different environmental conditions._

## Power Indicator

The LED indicator in the side switch shows the power status for 5 seconds after turning the TS22 on.

- **Green** Remaining battery power is good (more than 30%).

- **Red** Remaining battery power is poor (less than 30%).

- **Flashing Red** Critical power, replace or recharge battery as soon as possible.

- **Low Voltage Protection** If the battery’s voltage is lower than 2.7V, it turns off automatically to avoid battery damage by over discharge.

- **Button light** When off, fast click 5 times to turn on the button light (green), fast click 5 times to switch the button light mode (on --> flashing --> off; Cycle in turn). Note that after the button light is turned on, the auto lock function cannot be entered.
