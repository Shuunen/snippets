# Remapping Logitech Presenter R400 buttons

## 1. Detecting with evtest
```
sudo evtest
```
Look at the device list :
```
/dev/input/event0:	Lid Switch
/dev/input/event1:	Power Button
/dev/input/event2:	Sleep Button
/dev/input/event3:	Power Button
/dev/input/event4:	AT Translated Set 2 keyboard
/dev/input/event5:	Video Bus
/dev/input/event6:	USB Optical Mouse
/dev/input/event7:	AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint Stick
/dev/input/event8:	AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad
/dev/input/event9:	Logitech USB Receiver
/dev/input/event10:	Logitech USB Receiver
/dev/input/event11:	HDA Intel PCH Dock Mic
/dev/input/event12:	HDA Intel PCH Headset Mic
/dev/input/event13:	HDA Intel PCH Dock Line Out
/dev/input/event14:	HDA Intel PCH Headphone
/dev/input/event15:	HDA Intel PCH HDMI/DP,pcm=3
/dev/input/event16:	HDA Intel PCH HDMI/DP,pcm=7
/dev/input/event17:	HDA Intel PCH HDMI/DP,pcm=8
/dev/input/event18:	Integrated Webcam
/dev/input/event19:	Dell WMI hotkeys
Select the device event number [0-19]: 9
Input driver version is 1.0.1
Input device ID: bus 0x3 vendor 0x46d product 0xc52d version 0x111
Input device name: "Logitech USB Receiver"
```
Took the first "Logitech USB Receiver", here it has **event id 9**.
```
Testing ... (interrupt to exit)
```
Ok now evtest wants inputs, just click on the Logitech remote buttons, I got this (simplified) :
```
[>] value 7003e (KEY_PRESENTATION)
[>] value 70029 (KEY_PRESENTATION)
[ ] value 70037 (KEY_DISPLAYTOGGLE)
 <  value 7004b (KEY_PAGEUP)
 >  value 7004e (KEY_PAGEDOWN)
```
Note : I discovered after that clicking multiple times on [>] was giving 7003e then 70029 then 7003e etc... Don't know why.


## 2. Modifying udev conf
Now that we have input codes let's have a look at udev conf :
```
sudo gedit /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb
```
Search for "R400" and replace *presentation* & *displaytoggle* by what you want, here *up* & *down* arrow keys :
```
# Logitech Presenter R400
evdev:input:b0003v046DpC52D*
 KEYBOARD_KEY_07003e=up      # was "presentation"
 KEYBOARD_KEY_070029=up      # was "presentation"
 KEYBOARD_KEY_070037=down    # was "displaytoggle"
```
As previously noted, because 07003e & 070029 are the same button, I gaved them the same output *up* key.
The 7004b & 7004e does not appears here by default, maybe because they are native PAGEUP & PAGEDOWN inputs and not related to "Logitech Presenter R400". Let's add them :
```
 KEYBOARD_KEY_07004b=left   # freshly added
 KEYBOARD_KEY_07004e=right  # freshly added
```

## 3. Reloading *(new)* rules
```
sudo udevadm hwdb --update
```
Then by using the same event id we chose before, here **event id 9** :
```
sudo udevadm trigger /dev/input/event9
```
The end :)

You can check this new mapping in browser for example :
```
$('body').on('keydown', function(e){ console.log(e.key) })
```
That gave me :
```
[>] ArrowUp
[ ] ArrowDown
 <  ArrowLeft
 >  ArrowRight
```

# TODO

- Follow udev 60-keyboard.hwdb documentation & create a new conf file in /etc/udev/hwdb.d/70-keyboard.hwdb instead of modifying /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboard.hwdb


# Some of my tests 

## Detecting with xev
```
xev
```
Result :
```
[>] ???
[ ] ???
 <  keycode 112 (keysym 0xff55, Prior)
 >  keycode 117 (keysym 0xff56, Next)
```
We can see here that xev don't get keycode that are too high.

## Working temp changes with xmodmap
```
xmodmap -e "keycode 112 = Left"
xmodmap -e "keycode 117 = Right"
```
I prefered setting this with udev to avoid using udev & xmodmap conf.
