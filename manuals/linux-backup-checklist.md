## Ok, but before

Backup :

- [ ] home folder if not too large
- [ ] ssh keys, do `ls -la ~/.ssh` to check for existing ones
- [ ] standalone apps & binaries in `~/apps`
- [ ] wifi/eth security connectivity settings
- [ ] git/npm/xyz configs in home
- [ ] useful installed programs `dpkg --get-selections > /backup/installed-software.log`
- [ ] printers settings/ip
- [ ] hostname & hosts file
