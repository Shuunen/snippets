REM set need to be here, outside the logging section

REM the video file we want to set title to
REM like : "D:\Downloads\Big Buck Bunny (2003)\Big Buck Bunny (2003).mkv"
set targetFile=%1

REM this script folder
REM like : "D:\Apps\Set.Title\"
SET thisFolder=%~dp0

REM DO NOT try to pipe the output of this script to a file
REM because we need the user input in the console
ts-node-esm %thisFolder%/take-screenshot.cli.ts %targetFile%
